# Mock Assessment 1

## Section 1
1. Choose suitable variable to contain `meters` and `inch` value. (**Please use float**) 
2. This value is input by user
3. Write a function that takes in input argument `inch` and output argument `meter`.
```
Conversion Rate
1 inch = 0.0254 meters
```

### Console Output
```
Please enter the dimension (inch): 
Converting to meters...
Dimension meters is: _ m
```

## Section 2
1. Take the converted value (**meters**) and use it to calculate the area of a rectangle.
2. User to input length / width of rectangle
3. Calculation of Area of Rectangle will be processed in a function - `areaRect`

### Console Ouput
```
Please enter the length of the rectangle (inch): 
Please enter the width of the rectangle (inch): 
Area of Rectangle is: _ m2
```

## Section 3
1. Build a function, `areaCircle` that takes in input argument `radius`.
2. Import the following library
    * `import math`
3. the **pi** value can be called by using the following function `math.pi`

### Formula (Area of Circle)
```
Area of Circle = pi * r^2
```

### Console Output
```
Please enter radius (inch): 
Converting to meter...
Calculating area of circle...
Area of circle is: _ m2
```
